### Kaua e mate wheke mate ururoa
#### Don't die like a octopus, die like a hammerhead shark

Octopus are renown for their lack of resistance when being captured, however a hammerhead shark will fight bitterly to the end, to the point that when you fillet it fresh, its meat quivers. Don't give up, no matter how hard the struggle is!

```
function mihi() {
 fetch("Tēnā koutou katoa Ko Cameron tōku ingoa")
  .then("Nō Te Tairawhiti ki Tainui ahau")
}
```
